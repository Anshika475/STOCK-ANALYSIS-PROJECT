# STOCK-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
This project is a Stock Trend Prediction Web App built using Streamlit, PyTorch, and OpenAI GPT. It provides real-time predictions for stock trends based on historical data using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The app also includes a chatbot for engaging with users about stock-related questions.

Features
Stock Trend Prediction: Predicts the next day’s stock closing price using an LSTM-based machine learning model.

Competitor Comparison: Compare stock prices (both closing and opening prices) of the selected main stock with multiple competitors.

Quarterly Financial Data: Displays financial data including Total Revenue, Gross Profit, and Net Income for the selected stock and its competitors.

Chatbot: A conversational AI powered by OpenAI’s GPT model, providing responses based on user queries about the stock market.
